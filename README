CasperDG is a 2D unstructured triangle explicit Euler solver written by Andrew Kirby, University of Wyoming (2013).
The code is written in Fortran90. 

The spatial discretization is a modal DG FEM formulation.
It has H1, nodal, and monomial bases. 
It can do basisDegree = 0,1,2 polynomial orders for the basis.
Thus the solution degrees are first, second, and third order accurate, respectively.

The temporal discretization has Euler and Runke-Kutta four-stage implementations.


CapserDG.f90 is the main program file.
Currently, the code does not have an input file. All inputs are prescribed in 
CaspserDG.f90. When you change any inputs, recompile the code given the 
instructions below.

To compile using ifort (gfortran):
1.)	cd CasperDG/trunk/serial
2.)	make ifort   or   make gfortran

To clean the objects:
1.)	make clean


To run the executable (which is located in CasperDG/trunk/serial):
1.)	./casperDG.serial

There are various meshes located in the meshes folder located in the trunk folder.
There are two naca 0012 meshes, a fine bump mesh, and a coarse bump mesh.
All of the *aba.msh meshes are meshes with no bodies in them and are used for mesh resolution study.
